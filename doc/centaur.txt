INTRODUCTION                                    *centaur*

Centaur allows you to vertically center a text object in the viewport.
The viewport will be scrolled so that the block of lines defined by the
text object are positioned in the middle of the viewport, or, in the
case that the text object spans more lines than are available in the
viewport, the first line of the text object will be scrolled to the top
of the viewport.
